## Miscellaneous redistricting things. As projects develop, they will be moved to their own repository or merged in with existing work.

### Current projects:
+ `curve_shortening_flow` -- an exploration of district compactness by using curve-shortening flow
+ `assign-units` -- a code stub to assign district IDs to other geographic units, such as Census blocks
+ `graph-stats` -- a module to compute network statistics for dual graphs of states and districts
+ `maine-elections` -- semi-cleaned Maine state legislative elections data from 2016


### Other projects:
+ `polyominos`: subsumed by the Enumerator, currently at [zschutzman/enumerator](https://github.com/zschutzman/enumerator)
+ `spectral_chain`: broken by new releases of [gerrychain](https://github.com/mggg/gerrychain), currently being reworked

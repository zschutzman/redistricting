  		<h3> A case for "multiscale compactness" </h3>
  		<p>
  			While the gemoetric shape of a district is not the measure by which 
  			gerrymandering is defined, it often drives the popular narrative around 
  			what districts are and are not gerrymandered.  A quick Google search for 
  			a term like "most gerrymandered districts" will return a litany of articles 
  			naming-and-shaming districts like the Illinois-4th ("The Earmuffs"), the 
  			previous iteration of the North Carolina-12th ("The River"), and the 
  			Maryland-3rd ("The Praying Mantis").  While all three of these districts 
  			were (allegedly) drawn with some electoral intent, most of the press 
  			surrounding them is about their contorted shapes rather than their 
  			effect on the outcomes of elections.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			One of the most popular measures of compactness is called the <em>Polsby-Popper score</em>. 
  			One formulation of this is as $ \frac{4\pi \mathrm{Area}}{\mathrm{Perimeter}^2}$, and it has 
  			several attractive mathematical properties.  It's always a number 
  			between zero and one, and it's one exactly when the shape we're looking at is a circle. 
  			This score also varies continuously as the boundary of the shape is pulled and stretched.  
  			In other words, two shapes which differ by a microscopic amount will have almost the same score.  
  			Another nice property is that it is <em> scale-invariant </em>, meaning that blowing up a shape 
  			doesn't change it's Polsby-Popper score.  This means that it's appropriate to use this score to examine 
  			districts of different sizes.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			However, this score has some drawbacks which make its use in redistricting applications 
  			somewhat questionable.  First, it's very sensitive to small changes in the shape's boundary. 
  			A circle with a ragged boundary will have a much worse Polsby-Popper score than a snakey shape. 
  			<h1> do figure </h1>
  			This is a problem because many boundaries in political geography, such as city lines as 
  			well as coastlines and rivers are natural choices to use as district borders, but they tend to 
  			be jagged, which distorts the Polsby-Popper score.  This also means that the score is sensitive 
  			to the <em> resolution of measurement </em>.  As maps become more detailled, things like coastlines 
  			look more and more rough, and so the same district's Polsby-Popper score may vary by a factor of 
  			as much as three depending on how precise the geographic measurements are. Richard Barnes and Justin Solomon explore this in more detail 
  			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02857"> in their paper, here</a>.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			One way to avoid some of these issues is to try to keep more information about the shape 
  			of the district in our compactness score.  The Polsby-Popper score (and others) assign a single 
  			number to each district, but we can use some more sophisticated math to develop methods which 
  			assign a <em> vector </em> of numbers to each district and satisfy a few reasonable properties:


  			<ul>
  				<li>
  					<h4>Discrimative</h4> There should be a meaningful way of <em> ordering </em> districts based on the entries of the vector. 
  					For example, if we sort all of our districts by the first entry, the resulting order should say something 
  					about the relative compactness of the districts.
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					<h4>Explainable</h4> The measure should be easy to communicate to the parties invested in the redistricting process, 
  					including lawyers, politicians, interestd citizens, as well as mathematicians.
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					<h4>Stable</h4> Two similar shapes should be assigned similar vectors.
  				</li>				
  				<li>
  					<h4>Computable</h4> There should be an efficient algorithm for computing these scores, ideally from 
  					data available to the public.
  				</li>
  			</ul>
  			<h1> cite tv paper? </h1>
  			We'll use a small twist on a technique from differential geometry called <em>curve-shortening flow</em> to develop a 
  			multiscale compactness measure which satisfies these criteria.

  		<h3> Curve-Shortening Flow </h3>

  		<p>
  		What is curve-shortening flow? For those who care about such things, we'll restrict our attention to simple, closed 
  		curves in the plane.  Given such a curve, curve-shortening flow is a process which shrinks the region so that its 
  		<em> area </em> decreases at a constant rate and its <em> length </em> (<em>perimeter</em>) decreases as quickly as possible.  
  		This process will transform the boundary of any kind of region we might think of to a "round point" (the limit of a circle as 
  		you take its radius to zero).  We can intuitively think of curve-shortening flow as slowly "ironing out" the boundary of our region,
  		where it eliminates small wrinkles very quickly and takes a little bit longer to adjust large deformities.  Our small twist 
  		is that we also rescale the region at every step so that the area remains fixed.  Therefore, this process will slowly transform any shape 
  		into a circle of the same area.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Here's a brief animation of this transformation applied to MD-03, played forwards (district to circle) and backwards (circle to district).
</p>

<p>
The procedure to perform curve-shortening flow is pretty straightforward. At each point on the boundary of our region, 
we'll find the tangent line and move that point inward in the direction perpendicular to the tangent. How far to move it 
will depend on the <em> curvature </em> of the boundary at the point.  The last missing piece is to articulate a defintion 
of curvature.  Intuitively, curvature measures how "bendy" the boundary is at a particular point.  If our point lies in a very 
squiggly portion of the boundary, then the curvature is large. If our point is in a portion that looks like a straight line, 
then the curvature is small.  
</p>
<p>
Formally, we measure curvature in the following way. First, we can look at the neighborhood of our point on the boundary 
and imagine that it's a small segment on the circumference of a circle with some radius $r$, called the <em>osculating circle</em>.
<h1>do figure</h1>
Then, the curvature at that point is $1/r$ if it's a point of <em>positive curvature</em> or $-1/r$ if it's a point of 
<em>negative curvature</em>.  If we're truly looking at a point on a line segment, then we say that the curvature is zero.
</p>
<p>
	We can make two observations about the behavior of curve-shortening flow on a shape.  First, since points on really 
	curvy portions of the boundary are moved further, it should smooth out the boundary very quickly.  Second, since indentations 
	in the shape are pushed outward and appendages sticking out get pulled inward, the shape will get progressively "nicer" as we 
	run the process; it should never grow a new appendage or suddenly develop a jagged boundary.

<h3> Algorithmics </h3>
<p>
	The next concern is whether we can actually run curve-shortening flow on a real shape, or if 
	it just exists as a theoretical construct.  The procedure we described above applies to smooth 
	curves and technically requires we compute the curvature at every one of an infinite number of points, 
	which is no-good if we're concerned with developing something practical.  Furthermore, we conveniently 
	ignored how the procedure operates at points on the boundary which are not smooth, such as vertices of a 
	polygon.  Since the boundaries of districts are described as polygons in geographic shapefiles, 
	this behavior is more than simply a technicality.
</p>
<p>
	To solve this, we need both a sensible replacement for the tangent line at a point as well as a good 
	way to define curvature for things that aren't, well, <em>curved</em>.  The first is easy.  Recall from 
	differential calculus that the tangent line at a point is the limit of secant lines through pairs of points, 
	one on each side of our point, as these two points move closer to our point.  So, instead of using a tangent line, 
	we can use the line passing through two points very close to our point.  As we use more and more points to describe 
	the boundary of our shape, this secant becomes a better and better approximation of the true tangent line.
</p>
<p>
	For curvature, we're going to do something similar.  If we're close enough to our point, these secant lines are 
	chords of the osculating circle which meet the radius perpendicularly.  Since we can measure both the length of this 
	chord, which is the distance between our two nearby points, as well as the distance of our point from the chord, we can 
	recover the radius of the osculating circle.  Now, even if we can no longer define such a circle at the vertex of a polygon, 
	both of these distances are still well-defined, so there is some number we can assign to that point which is analogous 
	to curvature in the smooth case.  It's also easy to see that this number will still be zero if we look at a straight line 
	segment and it grows as the angle becomes more and more acute.

	<h3> Turining Curve-Shortening Flow into a Compactness Measure </h3>
	<p>
		We've given an explanation of curve-shortening flow and described how one might be able to implement an 
		algorithm to compute it, we can move on to designing a <em> compactness score </em> which can be derived 
		from it.  First, since we're playing around with things that depend on distances, we're going to assume that 
		all of the regions we might want to examine have the same area.  In our version of curve-shortening flow, 
		we keep the area of the region fixed

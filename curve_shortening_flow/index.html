  		<h3> A case for "multiscale compactness" </h3>
  		<p>
  			While the geometric shape of a district is not the measure by which 
  			gerrymandering is defined, it often drives the popular narrative around 
  			what districts are and are not gerrymandered.  A quick Google search for 
  			a term like "most gerrymandered districts" will return a litany of articles 
  			naming-and-shaming districts like the Illinois-4, the 
  			previous iteration of the North Carolina-12, and the 
  			Maryland-3.  While all three of these districts 
  			were (allegedly) drawn with some electoral intent, most of the press 
  			surrounding them is about their contorted shapes rather than their 
  			effect on the outcomes of elections.

  		<p>
  			One of the most popular measures of compactness is called the <em>Polsby-Popper score</em>. 
  			One formulation of this is as $ \frac{4\pi \mathrm{Area}}{\mathrm{Perimeter}^2}$, and it has 
  			several attractive mathematical properties.  It's always a number 
  			between zero and one, and it's one exactly when the shape we're looking at is a circle. 
  			This score also varies continuously as the boundary of the shape is pulled and stretched. 
  			Another nice property is that it is <em> scale-invariant </em>, meaning that blowing up a shape 
  			doesn't change it's Polsby-Popper score.  This means that it's appropriate to use this score to examine 
  			districts of different sizes.  
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			However, this score has some drawbacks which make its use in redistricting applications 
  			somewhat questionable.  First, it's very sensitive to small changes in the shape's boundary. 
  			A circle with a ragged boundary may have the same Polsby-Popper score as a very snaky shape.

  			This is a problem because many boundaries in political geography, such as city lines as 
  			well as coastlines and rivers are natural choices to use as district borders, but they tend to 
  			be jagged, which distorts the Polsby-Popper score.  This also means that the score is sensitive 
  			to the <em> resolution of measurement </em>.  As maps become more detailed, things like coastlines 
  			look more and more rough, and so the same district's Polsby-Popper score may vary by a factor of 
  			as much as three depending on how precise the geographic measurements are. Richard Barnes and Justin Solomon explore this in more detail 
  			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02857"> in their paper, here</a>.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			One way to avoid some of these issues is to try to keep more information about the shape 
  			of the district in our compactness score.  In this way, we can try to disentangle 
  			the instability from the boundary effects from the larger-scale geometric features of the shape.  
  			The Polsby-Popper score (and others) assign a single 
  			number to each district, but we can use some more sophisticated math to develop methods which 
  			assign a <em> list </em> of numbers to each district.  While we're thinking about more 
  			robust measures of compactness, we can write down a few reasonable properties
  			we'd like our measure to satisfy:


  			<ul>
  				<li>
  					<h4>Informative</h4> The score should provide meaningful information about the geometry of the district. Ideally, it 
            should allow us to compare two districting plans from the same state and make an assessment about their compactnesses 
            relative to each other.  					
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					<h4>Explainable</h4> The measure should be easy to communicate to the parties invested in the redistricting process, 
  					including lawyers, politicians, interested citizens, as well as mathematicians.
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					<h4>Stable</h4> Two similar shapes should be assigned similar vectors.
  				</li>				
  				<li>
  					<h4>Computable</h4> There should be an efficient algorithm for computing these scores, ideally from 
  					data available to the public.
  				</li>
  			</ul>
  			We'll use a small twist on a technique from differential geometry called <em>curve-shortening flow</em> to develop a 
  			multiscale compactness measure which satisfies these criteria.

  		<h3> Curve-Shortening Flow </h3>

  		<p>
  			What is curve-shortening flow? We'll restrict our attention to simple, closed curves in the plane, which means that it doesn't cross itself or 
         double back, and it forms the boundary of a region.  Given such a curve, curve-shortening flow is a process which shrinks the region so that its 
  			<em> area </em> decreases at a constant rate and its <em> length </em> (<em>perimeter</em>) decreases as quickly as possible.  
  			This process will transform the boundary of any kind of region we might think of to a "round point" (the limit of a circle as 
  			you take its radius to zero).  We can intuitively think of curve-shortening flow as slowly "ironing out" the boundary of our region,
  			where it eliminates small wrinkles very quickly and takes a little bit longer to adjust large deformities.  Our small twist 
  			is that we also rescale the region at every step so that the area remains fixed.  Therefore, this process will slowly transform any shape 
  			into a circle of the same area.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Here's a brief animation of this transformation applied to <span class="brown">MD-3</span>, played forwards (district to circle) and backwards (circle to district).
  		</p>


  		<div class="chart center" style="max-width:250px;max-height:250px;background:none;border:none;display:block;margin:auto ;padding:3px 3px 3px 3px;justify-content: center">

  		</div>



  		<p>
  			The procedure to perform curve-shortening flow is pretty straightforward. At each point on the boundary of our region, 
  			we'll find the tangent line and move that point inward in the direction perpendicular to the tangent. How far to move it 
  			will depend on the <em> curvature </em> of the boundary at the point.  The last missing piece is to articulate a definition 
  			of curvature.  Intuitively, curvature measures how "curvy" the boundary is at a particular point.  If our point lies on a very 
  			bendy portion of the boundary, then the curvature at that point is large. If our point is on a portion that looks like a straight line, 
  			then the curvature is small.  
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Formally, we can measure curvature in the following way. First, we can look at the neighborhood of our point on the boundary 
  			and imagine that it's a small segment on the circumference of a circle with some radius $r$, called the <em>osculating circle</em>.
  			Then, the curvature at that point is $1/r$ if it's a point of <em>positive curvature</em> or $-1/r$ if it's a point of 
  			<em>negative curvature</em>.  If we're looking at a point on a line segment, then we say that the curvature is zero.

  			In this small illustration, a step of curve-shortening flow will move the point with the small blue circle outward and the point with the large yellow circle inward, i the directions of the arrows.
  			Since the blue circle is smaller than the yellow circle, the first point will be moved <em>further</em> than the second.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			We can make two observations about the behavior of curve-shortening flow on a shape.  First, since points on really 
  			curvy portions of the boundary are moved further, it should smooth out the boundary very quickly.  Second, since indentations 
  			in the shape are pushed outward and appendages sticking out get pulled inward, the shape will get progressively "nicer" as we 
  			run the process; it should never grow a new appendage or suddenly develop a jagged boundary. 
  		</p>

  	<section>

  		<h3> Algorithmics </h3>
  		<p>
  			The next concern is whether we can actually run curve-shortening flow on a real shape, or if 
  			it just exists as a theoretical construct.  The procedure we described above applies to smooth 
  			curves and technically requires we compute the curvature at every one of an infinite number of points, 
  			which is no-good if we're concerned with developing something practical.  Furthermore, we conveniently 
  			ignored how the procedure operates at points on the boundary which are not smooth, such as vertices of a 
  			polygon.  Since the boundaries of districts are described as polygons in geographic shapefiles, 
  			this behavior is more than simply a technicality.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			To solve this, we need both a sensible replacement for the tangent line at a point as well as a good 
  			way to define curvature for things that aren't, well, <em>curved</em>.  Recall from 
  			differential calculus that the tangent line at a point is the limit of secant lines through pairs of points, 
  			one on each side of our point, as these two points move closer to our point.  So, instead of using a tangent line, 
  			we can use the line passing through two points very close to our point.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			For curvature, we're going to do something similar.  If we're close enough to our point, these secant lines are 
  			chords of the osculating circle which meet the radius perpendicularly.  Since we can measure both the length of this 
  			chord, which is the distance between our two nearby points, as well as the distance of our point from the chord, we can 
  			recover the radius of the osculating circle. It turns out (somewhat sensibly) that the radius of this circle is larger the 
  			wider the angle formed by our three points.
  			All of this sounds a little complicated, but once we go through this construction, we can convince ourselves of the fact that 
  			these substitutions mean that we move each vertex along the line which bisects its angle at a distance proportional to $\pi$ minus 
  			the measure of that angle.
  		</p>
  	</section>

  	<section>
  		<h3> Turning Curve-Shortening Flow into a Compactness Measure </h3>
  		<p>
  			We've given an explanation of curve-shortening flow and described how one might be able to implement an 
  			algorithm to compute it, we can move on to designing a <em> compactness score </em> which can be derived 
  			from it.  First, since we're playing around with things that depend on distances, we're going to assume that 
  			all of the regions we might want to examine have the same area.  In our version of curve-shortening flow, 
  			we keep the area of the region fixed and the perimeter decreases monotonically until the region becomes 
  			a circle, we might conjecture that regions which are more compact become circles more quickly than non-compact ones.  
  			Let's fix our area to be $\frac{1}{4\pi}$, which seems an odd choice, except that it makes the circle we get at the 
  			end of the process have circumference equal to one.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Our measure will be the plot of "number of curve-shortening flow steps" against the "perimeter of the figure at each step". 
  			We'll take a second to argue that this satisfies all four of our desiderata.  This page serves as explanation and in the 
  			previous section, we described a method to compute the curve-shortening flow procedure, which covers the first two items.  
  			The measure is stable since any small perturbation in a shape will be quickly smoothed out by the curve-shortening flow procedure, 
  			meaning that we get almost identical plots for two very similar shapes.  The final criterion is that the measure be informative, 
  			and we can at the very see that it's <em>at least </em> as informative as the Polsby-Popper score, since we can recover the 
        Polsby-Popper score from the information contained in these plots.  Specifically, because we've normalized the area of these shapes 
        very particularly, the Polsby-Popper score of a region is exactly $1/\mathrm{Perimeter}$ 
        after we've run zero steps of curve-shortening flow.  We'll see below that we can glean 
  			much more information that just the Polsby-Popper score from these plots, but since it's at least as good as a standard measure, 
  			we can be satisfied that our plots are not meaningless.

  		</p>
  	</section>

  	<section>
  		<h3>Comparing Plots</h3>
  		<p>
  			To demonstrate this measure, we'll examine the plots of three districts.  Below are images of the three districts as well as animations showing 
  			the progress of the curve-shortening flow procedure.  The plots on the right have the number of steps on the horizontal axis and the perimeter 
  			of the figure at that step on the vertical axis.  From left to right, these are "worst offenders" <span class="brown">MD-3</span>   
        and <span class="green">TX-35</span>, 
  			as well as <span class="blue">OK-1</span>.  Since these districts all come from different states, we should be careful not to use 
        this data to inform any judgment about whether or not these districts are part of a gerrymander.  This exercise is purely geometric.

  		<p>
  			There are a few things to observe here.  First, the plot for <span class="blue">OK-1</span> is below the other two at every point, and it requires 
  			far fewer steps of curve-shortening flow to become something (almost) circular.  These demonstrate that, with respect to our measure, <span class="blue">OK-1</span> is 
  			much more compact than the other two districts. 
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Second, we can look at the <em>shapes</em> of the three plots.  We observed that <span class="blue">OK-1</span>'s plot drops very quickly 
  			as it takes relatively few curve-shortening flow steps to transform it into a circle.  It's original form 
  			can be described as two joined rectangles with some irregularities at the boundary.  <span class="brown">MD-3</span>'s plot falls 
  			at a slower rate, which reflects the fact that the bizarreness of its geometry is not limited to its boundary, 
  			as once the curve-shortening flow smooths it out, what we're left with is something that looks like a snakey 'Y'. 
  			<span class="green">TX-35</span>'s plot falls quickly at the beginning but then slows down, being outpaced by <span class="brown">MD-3 </span>.  This is because the 
  			boundary smoothing reduces a lot of the district's perimeter, but the long, thin strip which stretches to the southwest 
  			requires many steps to pull inward.
  		</p>
		<p>

			We'll remark here that although we've set everything up for the <em>mathematical</em> comparison of 
			district shapes under curve-shortening flow to be sensible, it's important to recognize that these 
			comparisons do not, on their own, suggest that any state is or is not gerrymandered, and 
			it is particularly important to recognize that comparisons of compactness across different states 
			are even less meaningful, since different states have different geographic features, population 
			distributions, and legal constraints on the set of allowed districting plans.  As a concrete example, 
			it is hard to draw low-perimeter districts in Rhode Island due to its large amount of coastline and 
			small area with dense population, whereas Iowa has much more regular borders, a legal requirement to preserve counties 
			(which also have regular borders), and a fairly sparse population distribution.  Rhode Island's districts 
			being less compact than Iowa's with respect to any measure does not suggest that Rhode Island is gerrymandered 
			or that Iowa is not.

    <p>
      To examine a proper comparison of districting plans under the curve-shortening flow compactness measure, we've 
      computed the plots for the districts in three different plans for North Carolina.  The first is the plan which was 
      enacted in 2011 and ruled invalid in 2016 as a racial gerrymander, and its flow progressions are represented by the 
      <span class="purple">purple</span> dashed plots.  During the challenge to this plan, a non-partisan group of retired judges proposed a more "fair" 
      plan which is represented below with the solid <span class="teal">teal</span> plots. The last is the plan enacted in 2016 as the replacement for the invalid one, which is 
      currently being challenged in the courts as a partisan gerrymander, and its flow progressions are plotted with dotted 
      <span class="orange">orange</span>  lines.  
    </p>

    <summary>

      Mouse over a column of districts to highlight the three corresponding plots in the graph.  
      The shaded regions are the average plus/minus one standard deviation of the value of all 
      districts in the plan after a particular number of rounds of curve-shortening flow.

<summary style="font-size:.7rem">
 The 2011 districts and 2016 districts come from the U.S. Census Bureau's Tigerline files.
 The shapes for the judges' plan were graciously provided by Jonathan Mattingly and his group 
 at Duke University.
</summary>


<section>
  


<p> In this figure we can see that the <span class="purple">2011 plan</span> as a whole is less compact than the 
  <span class="orange"> 2016 plan</span>, which is less compact than the <span class= "teal">judges' plan</span>. 
  We can see that the average <span class="purple">purple</span> plot begins above the average <span class="orange">orange</span> 
  one, but the plots very quickly meet.  This suggests that the difference in compactness between the <span class="purple">2011 plan</span> 
  and the <span class="orange">2016 plan</span> is attributable to boundary effects rather than the districts being fundamentally more 
  regularly shaped.  You can recongize this intuitively by observing that the shapes of the districts are pretty similar between the 
  <span class="purple">2011 plan</span> and the <span class="orange">2016 plan</span>, except that the <span class="purple">2011 plan</span> 
  has the <span class="purple">2011 NC-12</span>, represented by the <span class="purple">purple</span> plot which is way 
  above the others, pulls the average upward. Second, the <span class="purple">2011 districts</span> have more small tendrils 
  which make them less compact, but these are ironed out relatively quickly by the curve-shortening flow process.
</p>
<p>
  The <span class= "teal">judges' plan</span>'s average is significantly below the other two until we have run the curve-shortening flow 
  for a long time.  Thus suggests, that unlike the <span class="orange">2016 plan</span>, the districts in the <span class= "teal">judges' plan</span> 
  have fundamentally more compact shapes than the <span class= "purple">2011 plan</span>, rather than simply having nicer boundaries.

</p>
<p>
This example highlights a fundamental weakness in using the Polsby-Popper score, or any other single-valued compactness measure.  The average Polsby-Popper 
scores of the plans are represented by the far left ends of the plots.  Looking only at these numbers, we'd conclude that the <span class="orange">2016 plan</span> 
is much more compact than the <span class="purple">2011 plan</span>.  However, by using a richer, multiscale compactness measure, we can 
observe that this is not the case, and we can make the more nuanced observation that the <em>boundaries</em> of the districts in the 
<span class="orange">2016 plan</span> are nicer than those of the <span class="purple">2011 plan</span>, but the <em>shapes</em> are 
fairly similar.

  			image and you can use the buttons with arrows move through the curve-shortening flow animations.  
        Can you find districts which appear to be non-compact because of their large perimeters but have plots which 
  			drop off very rapidly?  Are there districts which the flow process sends to circles even more slowly than it does for <span class="green">TX-35</span> and 
  			<span class="brown">MD-3</span>? Are there districts which are less compact under this measure than some of the "worst offenders" from 
        popular media articles?

<summary style="font-size:.7rem">
 Small islands have been removed from many coastal districts, including the Alaskan Aelutians.  
  Hawaii's districts both span several islands, so the shapes presented here are not accurately 
  descriptive of the state's districts.

  We extracted these shapes from a modified version of the U.S. Census Bureau's Cartographic Boundary File. 
  The Cartographic Boundary File is clipped to the coastline, so the North Carolina districts which border the 
  ocean appear differently here than in the previous figure.

  			<h3> In Conclusion...</h3>
  			<p>
  				We began by articulating 
  				a case for using <em> multiscale compactness</em> measures which capture more information than single scalar 
  				scores can.  Our reason for this is the observation that scores like Polsby-Popper are highly sensitive to 
  				boundary effects which are prevalent in geographic applications.  We introduced the use of curve-shortening 
  				flow as an example of a multiscale measure which captures meaningful information about the geometry of a district 
  				without being susceptible to the perturbative effects which distort Polsby-Popper scores.
  			</p>
  			<p>
  				We point out here that we are not proposing these scores or the data presented in this page be used to 
  				support or challenge any districting plan, as gerrymandering is not a function solely of the geometry of a 
  				districting plan.  In particular, an analysis of alleged gerrymandering demands the incorporation of 
  				demographic and economic data as well as comparisons to the other possible plans which could have been 
  				enacted, since geography and population distributions place significant constraints on which districting plans 
  				are and are not feasible.
  			</p>
  			<p>
  				Rather, we hope that this page and the interactives inspire the application of more modern mathematical 
  				methods to the redistricting problem as well as challenge the popular narrative that scalar measures of compactness 
  				strictly define what is and is not a gerrymander.
